2. Problem Content
	Milly is playing with an array A of size N. She is trying to find those non-empty subarrays (sequence of consecutive elements) whose maximum and minimum values are identical. Milly got confused while counting. Your task is to help her in this problem.

3. Boundary Conditions
	1 ≤ T ≤ 10
	1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5	
	1 ≤ |Ai| ≤ 10^9
	Here, || denotes the absolute value.
	
4. Input Format
	First line of the input will contain T denoting the number of test-cases.
For every test case, first line will contain N. Next line will contain N space separated integers denoting Ai.

5. Output Format
	For every test case, print the required answer in a separate line.

9. Solution:

t=int(input())
ans=[]
while(t):
    n=int(input())
    lst=list(map(int,input().split()))
    c=n
    count=1
    first=lst[0]
    for i in range(1,n):
        if(first==lst[i]):
            count+=1
        else:
            while(count):
                count-=1
                c+=count
            count=1
            first=lst[i]
    t-=1
    ans.append(c)
for i in ans:
    print(i)
