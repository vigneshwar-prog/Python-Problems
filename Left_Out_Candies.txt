1. Problem Title
	Left_Out_Candies
2. Problem Content
	Today, N candies were placed on the table. At any point, for the purpose of clarity, let X represent the number of candies left on the table. Every day, at 9 PM, if the number of candies remaining is divisible by 2, the child will take exactly X/2 candies. Otherwise, he will take (X+1)/2 candies.

In addition, every day at 10 PM, another child will come and take X//4, where the "//" here represents integer division. Please, find the number of candies left at 11 PM after T days have passed.
	
3. Boundary Conditions
	1<=Q<=10
	1<=N<=10^16
	1<=T<=50

4. Input Format
	The first line contains one integer, Q, the number of test cases.
	The next Q lines contain two integers, N and T.

5. Output Format
	Output Q lines, the answer for each test case.

6. 2 Samples with Input    and Output and in those 2, 1 sample must be explained

SAMPLE INPUT

Here 2 candies are there at initial day, at 9PM half will be decreased therefore, 1 candy if left, at 10 PM roundof(remaining candy//4) is decreased therefore 1 candy will be left.

9. Solution:
q=int(input())
while(q):
    q-=1
    n,t=map(int,input().split())
    while(t):
        t-=1
        if(n%2==0):
            n=n-(n//2)
        else:
            n=n-((n+1)//2)
        n=n-(n//4)
    print(n)
